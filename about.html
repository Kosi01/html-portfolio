<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an engineering student at Covenant University. I enjoy learning new
  things and working with people.
</p>

<p>
  I recently picked up web development because I felt a need to learn to build
  applications that can fix common problems i have(the world has also been
  shifting to technology big time), also to learn to think sequentially.
</p>

<p>
  On a lighter note, I love a good kdrama. I love dressing up and just reading
  and writing, recently my doom scrolling increased but I'm trying to get back
  into my reading and writing loop.
